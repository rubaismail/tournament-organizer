A few related programs that demonstrate profiency in C using various Data Structures and Algs.

Project 1: Dynamic Memory Allocation in a Soccer Tournament System
This project is a C-based simulation of an international soccer tournament that leverages dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation to manage complex data structures. 
The system dynamically allocates memory to handle teams, players, matches, and goal events, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of tournament data. 
Key functionalities include identifying the highest-scoring player, determining match winners, detecting hat tricks, and computing the tournament champion based on defined scoring rules. This assignment provided an in-depth exploration of dynamic memory techniques, rigorous pointer management, and the implementation of multiple command-based queries to analyze and process real-time sports data.
