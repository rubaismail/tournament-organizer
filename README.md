A few related programs that demonstrate profiency in C using various Data Structures and Algs.

1. a system to store tournament data, facilitate queries, and perform data analytics.

2. Background:
  Tickets must be bought in advance, but the ticketing center wasnâ€™t prepared to handle
  such a high volume of customers. There is only one counter with a single employee working to sell
  tickets. To disguise this, the center has set up 12 lines, with customers directed to one of them. Note that,
  some lines out of these 12 lines could be empty as well.
  When a customer arrives, their arrival time, last name, line number, and the number of tickets they plan
  to buy are recorded before they join a queue to meet the ticketing employee. Upon reaching the counter,
  they must also provide details for each ticket they are purchasing, which adds to the processing time.
  After assisting a customer, the cashier checks the status of all the active lines. The customer at the front
  of each queue with the fewest tickets will be served next. If multiple customers are buying the same
  minimum number of tickets, the cashier will choose the one from the lowest-numbered line. The lines
  are numbered from 1 to 12, and any empty lines are ignored.
  The time it takes for the cashier to process a customer is 20 seconds, plus 10 seconds per ticket.
