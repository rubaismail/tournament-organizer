A few related programs that demonstrate profiency in C using various Data Structures and Algs.

Project 1: Dynamic Memory Allocation in a Soccer Tournament System
This project is a C-based simulation of an international soccer tournament that leverages dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation to manage complex data structures. 
The system dynamically allocates memory to handle teams, players, matches, and goal events, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of tournament data. 
Key functionalities include identifying the highest-scoring player, determining match winners, detecting hat tricks, and computing the tournament champion based on defined scoring rules. This assignment provided an in-depth exploration of dynamic memory techniques, rigorous pointer management, and the implementation of multiple command-based queries to analyze and process real-time sports data.

Program 2: Soccer Match Ticketing Queues using Linked Lists
This project simulates a high-volume soccer match ticketing system using dynamic data structures in C. It implements 12 separate queues—each built as a linked list—to manage customer arrivals. Customers are assigned to a queue based on their arrival time, line number, and number of tickets they plan to purchase. The system then simulates the checkout process at a single counter, selecting the next customer based on who has the fewest tickets (with ties broken by line number) and calculates the processing time, which is determined by a fixed base time plus an incremental time per ticket. The assignment emphasizes dynamic memory allocation for customers and linked list nodes, as well as efficient queue operations (init, enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty). This project provided a practical understanding of queues, linked lists, and dynamic memory management in the context of a real-world simulation.
